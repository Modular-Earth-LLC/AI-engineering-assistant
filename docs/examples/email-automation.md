# Email Automation Example

**Use Case:** Automated email classification and response generation  
**Results:** 10-20x faster responses, >90% accuracy  
**Stack:** Claude Haiku + Gmail API

---

## Business Problem

**Current state:** 10 hours/week manually responding to customer emails  
**Pain points:**
- Slow response times (24-48 hours)
- Inconsistent responses
- High-value time spent on routine emails

**Desired outcome:** Automated triage and draft responses for 80% of emails

---

## System Design

### Architecture

**Multi-Agent System:**
1. **Classifier Agent** (Claude Haiku)
   - Categorizes incoming emails
   - Routes to appropriate handler
   - Flags urgent/complex cases for human review

2. **Response Agent** (Claude Sonnet)
   - Generates draft responses
   - Adapts tone to email type
   - Includes relevant information

### Tech Stack

- **LLM:** Claude Haiku (classification), Claude Sonnet (responses)
- **Integration:** Gmail API
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI
- **Storage:** Local JSON for templates
- **Cost:** ~$50-100/month (based on 500 emails/week)

---

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Classification (Week 1)

Built Classifier Agent to categorize emails:
- Support requests
- Sales inquiries
- General questions
- Urgent issues

**Accuracy:** 95% correct classification

### Phase 2: Response Generation (Week 2)

Built Response Agent to draft replies:
- Template-based for common questions
- Custom generation for unique cases
- Human review before sending

**Quality:** 90% of drafts sent without edits

---

## Results

**Time Savings:**
- Before: 10 hours/week
- After: 1 hour/week (review only)
- **Savings:** 90% reduction

**Response Time:**
- Before: 24-48 hours
- After: 1-2 hours
- **Improvement:** 10-20x faster

**Quality:**
- Consistency: Improved (standardized responses)
- Customer satisfaction: No decrease
- Escalation rate: 10% to human review

---

## Deployment

**Platform:** Cursor IDE (development), AWS Lambda (production)  
**Integration:** Gmail API webhook triggers email processing  
**Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs and metrics

---

## Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- Using cheaper model (Haiku) for classification
- Human-in-the-loop for learning phase
- Template library for common scenarios

**Challenges:**
- Edge cases requiring human judgment
- Maintaining tone consistency
- Integration with existing email workflow

**Future improvements:**
- Add sentiment analysis
- Expand to other channels (Slack, tickets)
- Automated learning from human edits
