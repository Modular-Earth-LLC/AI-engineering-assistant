## Knowledge Base Integration

### Shared State Management
All agents share state through JSON files in the `knowledge_base/` directory:

**system_config.json**
- Platform constraints and capabilities
- Team information and skills
- AWS Well-Architected Framework definitions
- Used by: All agents for context

**user_requirements.json**
- Business context and problem statement
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Success criteria and metrics
- Written by: Requirements Agent
- Read by: Architecture, Engineering, Optimization Agents

**design_decisions.json**
- Tech stack selections
- Architecture diagrams and decisions
- Cost estimates and project plans
- Implementation learnings
- Written by: Architecture Agent
- Read by: Engineering, Deployment, Optimization Agents

### Agent Handoff Protocol
1. **Agent A** completes its phase and updates knowledge base
2. **Supervisor Agent** detects completion
3. **Supervisor Agent** routes to **Agent B** with context
4. **Agent B** reads relevant knowledge base files
5. **Agent B** continues work with full context

## Best Practices

### For Users
- **Start with Supervisor Agent** for any new project
- **Follow the workflow sequence** (Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Engineering ‚Üí Deployment)
- **Let agents hand off naturally** - don't skip phases
- **Review knowledge base files** after each phase
- **Use specific agents** for focused tasks

### For Agent Interaction
- **Maintain context** across agent transitions
- **Reference knowledge base** for shared state
- **Delegate complex tasks** to specialized agents
- **Validate prerequisites** before starting new phases
- **Document decisions** in knowledge base

### For System Design
- **Follow AWS Well-Architected principles** throughout
- **Consider platform constraints** early in design
- **Plan for scalability** and maintainability
- **Include testing and monitoring** from the start
- **Document architectural decisions** clearly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent can't find knowledge base files**
- Ensure you're running from repository root
- Check file paths: `knowledge_base/[file].json`

**Supervisor not routing correctly**
- Be specific about what you want to accomplish
- Use clear, action-oriented language
- Reference the agent capabilities above

**Missing context between agents**
- Verify knowledge base files are populated
- Check that previous phase completed successfully
- Use Supervisor Agent to maintain workflow context

**Agent asks too many questions**
- Provide context upfront
- Reference existing knowledge base files
- Be specific about your requirements

### Getting Help

**For workflow questions:** Ask the Supervisor Agent  
**For specific tasks:** Use the appropriate specialized agent  
**For system issues:** Check knowledge base files  
**For platform questions:** See `ARCHITECTURE.md`
