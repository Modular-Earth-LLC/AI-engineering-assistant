## What Was Merged

### 6 Specialized Agents

---

## What Was Preserved

### Prompt Engineering Assistant (100% Backward Compatible)
- All original functionality preserved
- All 7 user prompts maintained
- Self-improvement capabilities intact
- Platform-specific optimization preserved
- Production-proven workflows unchanged

### Existing Workflows
- All original prompt engineering workflows work exactly as before
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- User prompts accessible in new categorical structure
- Knowledge base integration is optional (not required)

---

## What Was NOT Migrated

### Excluded Items
- Python test scripts (per user instruction)
- Git history (clean copy approach used)
- Duplicate files (merged intelligently)

---

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Supervisor Agent Orchestration
- Supervisor Agent now recognizes Prompt Engineering Assistant as 6th specialized agent
- Intelligent routing includes prompt engineering scenarios
- Workflow documentation shows agent collaboration patterns

### 2. Engineering Agent Integration
- Engineering Agent can invoke Prompt Engineering Assistant for complex prompts
- Clear separation: basic prompts (Engineering) vs. complex prompts (Prompt Engineering)
- Future evolution documented (will split into specialized agents)

### 3. Knowledge Base Integration
- Prompt Engineering Assistant can optionally read knowledge base files
- Context-aware optimization when working on tracked systems
- Independent operation maintained (doesn't require knowledge base)

### 4. Cross-Agent Collaboration
- Optimization Agent can recommend Prompt Engineering for prompt-level improvements
- Architecture Agent can reference Prompt Engineering for multi-agent prompt design
- Clear delegation patterns established
