# Optimization Agent Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Agent:** Optimization Agent  
**Test Scenario:** "Analyze this AI system for optimization opportunities"  
**Purpose:** Validate system analysis and Well-Architected assessment

---

## Test Execution

### Input
```
User Request: "Analyze this AI system for optimization opportunities"
```

### Expected Behavior
1. Ask clarifying questions (which system? what focus?)
2. Discover system structure systematically
3. Assess against Well-Architected Framework
4. Propose prioritized improvements
5. Distinguish from prompt-level improvements (Prompt Engineering Agent domain)

### Simulated Agent Response

```
I'll help you optimize your AI system. To provide the best recommendations, I need to understand:

**What would you like to optimize?**
- This AI Architecture Assistant framework (meta-optimization)
- A specific AI system you've designed (please provide path/location)
- An external AI system (please describe or provide repository)

[User answers]: "A customer support chatbot I built - it's in outputs/prototypes/support-bot/"

**What's your primary optimization focus?**
- [ ] Performance (response time, throughput, latency)
- [ ] Cost (model selection, API usage, infrastructure)
- [ ] Quality (accuracy, consistency, error handling)
- [ ] User Experience (workflow clarity, documentation, onboarding)
- [ ] Structure (code organization, modularity, maintainability)
- [ ] All of the above (comprehensive optimization)

[User answers]: "Cost and performance"

**How would you like me to proceed?**
- Analyze first, then get your approval before implementing
- Analyze and implement high-priority improvements automatically
- Just provide recommendations without implementing

[User answers]: "Analyze first"

<thinking>
Target: outputs/prototypes/support-bot/
Focus: Cost + Performance optimization
Approach: Analyze first, get approval before changes
Platform: Need to discover
</thinking>

Perfect! I'll analyze your customer support chatbot for cost and performance optimization opportunities.

**Phase 1: Discover & Assess**

<thinking>
Discovering system structure...
- Root: outputs/prototypes/support-bot/
- Files: Checking for prompts/, src/, configuration
- Architecture: Likely single-agent or small multi-agent
- Platform: Need to identify from code/config
</thinking>

✅ **System Discovery Complete:**
- **Type:** Single-agent chatbot
- **Platform:** Claude API (Anthropic)
- **Files:** 1 agent prompt, 3 Python files, 1 Streamlit UI
- **Lines of Code:** ~400
- **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Assessment Results:**

**Strengths:**
✅ Working demo with Streamlit UI
✅ Clear prompt structure
✅ Basic error handling

**Improvement Opportunities:**

| Category | Finding | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Cost | Using Sonnet for simple FAQs | HIGH | 1 hr | P0 |
| Performance | No response caching | HIGH | 2 hrs | P0 |
| Performance | Verbose prompt (1800 tokens) | MEDIUM | 2 hrs | P1 |
| Quality | Missing input validation | MEDIUM | 3 hrs | P1 |

**Compliance Score:** 7.5/10 (good, needs improvements)

---

**Phase 2: Proposed Improvements**

**Priority 0 (Quick Wins - 3 hours):**

1. **Switch to Haiku for FAQs** (1 hr)
   - Use Claude Haiku for simple FAQ questions
   - Use Sonnet only for complex queries
   - Benefit: 80% cost reduction on FAQs (~$120/month savings)

2. **Add Response Caching** (2 hrs)
   - Cache common question responses
   - Implement prompt caching for system instructions
   - Benefit: 60% faster response time, 40% cost reduction

**Expected Impact:** 50-70% cost reduction, 60% faster responses

---

**Shall I proceed with Priority 0 optimizations?**
[Yes / Modify plan / Review details / Proceed with all priorities]

```
