## Workflow Integration

### Requirements Phase
```
Requirements Agent → outputs/presentations/[project]/requirements/
                   → requirements_summary.md
                   → pain_points_analysis.md
                   → ai_opportunities.md
```

### Architecture Phase
```
Architecture Agent → outputs/presentations/[project]/architecture/
                   ├─ tech_stack_selection.md
                   ├─ architecture_diagram.[format]
                   ├─ team_composition.md
                   ├─ loe_estimates.md
                   ├─ cost_analysis.md
                   └─ project_plan.md

Architecture Agent → outputs/presentations/[project]/diagrams/
                   ├─ architecture_diagram.mermaid
                   ├─ architecture_diagram.ascii
                   ├─ architecture_diagram.png (if generated)
                   └─ data_flow_diagram.[format]
```

### Proposal Assembly
```
Architecture Agent → outputs/presentations/[project]/proposals/
                   ├─ pitch_deck.md (for clients/investors)
                   ├─ internal_proposal.md (for executives)
                   ├─ executive_summary.md
                   └─ technical_appendix.md
```

### Engineering Phase
```
Engineering Agent → outputs/prototypes/[project]/
                  └─ [Complete working prototype]
```

## For AI Engineers

**When starting a new project:**

1. Architecture Agent automatically creates: `outputs/presentations/[project-name]/`
2. Each design step outputs deliverable to appropriate subfolder
3. Proposal assembly prompts combine assets into presentation formats
4. Engineering Agent creates: `outputs/prototypes/[project-name]/`

**Version control:**
- Commit presentation outputs after each architecture step
- Tag important milestones (architecture complete, proposal approved)
- Track changes to requirements and design decisions

---

## For Presentation Assembly

**Two presentation types available:**

### 1. Pitch Deck (External)
**File:** `user_prompts/proposals/pitch_deck_assembly.user.prompt.md`

**Target Audience:** Clients, investors, external stakeholders

**Format:** Markdown → Google Slides or PowerPoint

**Focus:**
- Problem and solution (clear value proposition)
- ROI and business case
- Technical credibility (architecture demonstrates capability)
- Timeline and deliverables
- Risk mitigation
- Team credentials

---

### 2. Internal Proposal (Internal)
**File:** `user_prompts/proposals/internal_proposal_assembly.user.prompt.md`

**Target Audience:** Internal executives (CEO, CFO, CTO, VPs)

**Format:** Markdown → PowerPoint or PDF

**Focus:**
- Strategic alignment
- Detailed ROI and cost analysis
- Resource requirements (team, budget, timeline)
- Risk assessment and change management
- Technical feasibility evidence
- Success metrics and measurement approach

## Questions?

**Q: When do I use presentations vs. prototypes folders?**

A: 
- **Presentations:** Architecture deliverables (diagrams, plans, proposals) for executive/client review
- **Prototypes:** Working code for hands-on demos and validation

**Q: Can I customize the output structure?**

A: Yes! Modify agents to output to your preferred structure. Current structure follows best practices for typical AI projects.

**Q: How do I assemble into PowerPoint/Google Slides?**

A: Use presentation assembly prompts which generate Markdown formatted for conversion tools like Marp, Slidev, or direct import to Google Slides.
