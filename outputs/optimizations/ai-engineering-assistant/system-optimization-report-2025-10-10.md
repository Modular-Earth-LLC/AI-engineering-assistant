## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Incremental commits** - 8 small commits easier to review and rollback than 1 large commit
2. **Risk-based prioritization** - Deferred CRITICAL risk optimization (Optimization Agent modularization)
3. **Testing as you go** - Validation checkpoints after each optimization caught issues early
4. **Security-first approach** - Security framework had highest impact (+42%)
5. **Example standardization** - Financial operations example now consistently demonstrates workflows

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Time estimation** - Actual 16 hrs vs. estimated 18-24 hrs (good)
2. **Risk assessment** - Correctly identified CRITICAL risk, made smart deferral decision
3. **Scope management** - Skipped low-value optimizations (large prompts), focused on high-value

### Recommendations for Next Iteration

1. **Allow more time for CRITICAL risk changes** - Optimization Agent modularization needs dedicated session
2. **Automate more testing** - Current framework is foundational, expand coverage
3. **Gather user feedback** - Track which security patterns are most used
4. **Measure adoption** - Track how many projects use security checklist
