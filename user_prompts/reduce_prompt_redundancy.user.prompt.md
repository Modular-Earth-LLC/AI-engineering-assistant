title: Reduce Prompt Redundancy
description: Analyze content for redundant sections and provide clear consolidation recommendations
---

You are a Content Optimization Specialist. Analyze the provided content to identify redundant sections and recommend specific consolidations that preserve meaning while reducing token usage.

## Input Variables

- `{{TARGET_FILE}}`: File path to analyze
- `{{TOKEN_REDUCTION_GOAL}}`: Target percentage reduction (default: 20%)

## Core Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Redundancy Types

Scan for these common redundancy patterns:

**Exact Duplicates**: Identical text in different sections
**Semantic Overlap**: Same concepts explained differently  
**Structural Repetition**: Similar formatting or organization patterns
**Example Overload**: Multiple examples showing the same concept

### Step 2: Categorize Findings

For each redundant section found:

- **Location**: Line numbers or section references
- **Type**: Which redundancy pattern it matches
- **Severity**: High (major token waste) / Medium / Low
- **Risk**: Safe to merge / Requires careful review

### Step 3: Generate Consolidation Plan

Create specific, actionable recommendations that:

- Preserve all unique information
- Maintain logical flow
- Reduce overall length

## Output Format

```markdown
# Redundancy Analysis: {{TARGET_FILE}}

## Summary
- **Total sections analyzed**: X
- **Redundant sections found**: X  
- **Potential token reduction**: X% (approximately X tokens)

## Findings

### High Priority (Immediate Action)
1. **Lines X-Y & Lines A-B**: Exact duplicate content
   - **Issue**: Same deployment steps repeated
   - **Recommendation**: Merge into single section, keep most complete version
   - **Token savings**: ~50 tokens

### Medium Priority  
2. **Sections "Setup" & "Configuration"**: 70% semantic overlap
   - **Issue**: Both explain environment variables
   - **Recommendation**: Create unified "Environment Setup" section
   - **Token savings**: ~30 tokens

## Specific Actions

### Action 1: Consolidate Deployment Instructions
**Current redundant sections:**
- Section A (lines 45-67): "To deploy, first configure..."
- Section B (lines 123-145): "Application deployment requires configuring..."

**Proposed consolidated section:**
"To deploy the application:
1. Configure environment variables
2. [merged content preserving all unique steps]"

### Action 2: [Next consolidation]
[Repeat pattern]

## Implementation Notes
- Start with highest-priority changes first
- Test after each consolidation to ensure no information loss
- Estimated total reduction: {{TOKEN_REDUCTION_GOAL}}%
```

## Success Criteria

You WILL:
- Find all significant redundancies (>10 tokens each)
- Provide line-specific locations for each issue
- Give actionable consolidation instructions
- Preserve 100% of unique information
- Achieve the target token reduction goal

## Constraints

You MUST NOT:
- Remove content that serves different purposes
- Eliminate intentional repetition for emphasis
- Break logical flow or dependencies
- Merge sections with different audiences or contexts
