title: Improve System of Prompts
description: Analyzes and optimizes interactions between multiple prompts working as a system, eliminating redundancy and ensuring perfect complementarity
---

## Objective

Analyze and improve a system of prompts (2 or more) to ensure they work together seamlessly without redundancy. Focus on optimizing information flow, element distribution, and system-level coherence.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Access to all prompts in the system
- Understanding of the intended workflow
- Clear picture of the target users and use cases

## Instructions

### 1. System Analysis Phase

First, identify all prompts in the system:

- **System Prompt(s)**: Define agent behavior, capabilities, and context
- **User Prompt(s)**: Specify tasks or queries for the agent
- **Multi-shot Prompts**: Additional prompts in workflow sequences

For each prompt, extract and categorize:

- Role/Mission definitions
- Success criteria
- Context and knowledge
- Instructions and processes
- Constraints and guardrails
- Response formats
- Variables and parameters

Create a mapping table:

| Element | Current Location | Optimal Location | Rationale |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Example | System & User | System only | Persistent behavior |

### 2. Redundancy Detection

Identify redundancies across the prompt system:

- **Duplicate Definitions**: Same concepts defined multiple times
- **Repeated Context**: Information unnecessarily restated
- **Overlapping Instructions**: Similar guidance in different prompts
- **Redundant Constraints**: Rules specified in multiple places
- **Variable Conflicts**: Same variable with different meanings

Mark redundancies by severity:

- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Direct contradictions or conflicts
- ðŸŸ¡ **Major**: Significant duplication affecting clarity
- ðŸŸ¢ **Minor**: Small overlaps that could be optimized

### 3. Optimization Strategy

Apply these principles to eliminate redundancy:

**System Prompt Should Contain:**

- Agent identity, capabilities, and persistent behavior
- Universal constraints and guardrails
- Core knowledge and context
- Standard operating procedures
- Default response formats
- Global variables and their meanings
- Error handling patterns

**User Prompt Should Contain:**

- Specific task parameters
- Variable values for current execution
- Task-specific success criteria
- Contextual overrides (if needed)
- References to system capabilities (not redefinitions)
- Execution triggers and conditions

**Multi-shot Prompts Should:**

- Build on previous context without repetition
- Pass forward only new information
- Reference prior outputs explicitly
- Maintain clear dependencies
- Include checkpoint validations
- Handle state transitions cleanly

### 4. Implementation Approach

Calculate change impact: `(Lines Changed / Total Lines) Ã— 100`

**For Minor Improvements** (< 20% content change):

- Make direct file edits immediately
- Document changes in edit summaries
- Preserve file structure and formatting

**For Major Improvements** (â‰¥ 20% content change):

1. Present analysis of current system
2. Propose optimization plan with rationale
3. Confirm approach with user
4. Implement approved changes
5. Run validation checks

**Handling Conflicts:**

When elements conflict between prompts:

1. Identify the authoritative source
2. Document the resolution rationale
3. Update all references consistently
4. Add clarifying comments if needed

### 5. System Validation

After improvements, validate:

**Coherence Check:**

- [ ] Each element appears in exactly one optimal location
- [ ] Information flows logically between prompts
- [ ] No circular dependencies exist
- [ ] Clear execution order for multi-shot workflows
- [ ] Variables are defined before use
- [ ] No undefined references

**Completeness Check:**

- [ ] All original functionality preserved
- [ ] No critical information lost in deduplication
- [ ] System covers all intended use cases
- [ ] Edge cases remain handled
- [ ] Error messages still meaningful

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Basic Flow**: Run standard task through improved system
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with unusual parameters or missing data
3. **Multi-shot**: Verify sequences execute with proper state
4. **Error Paths**: Confirm graceful failure handling
5. **Variable Substitution**: Check all {{variables}} resolve

### 6. Output Format

Provide improvements in this structure:

1. **Analysis Summary**: High-level findings and impact
2. **Change Plan**: Specific modifications needed
3. **Implementation**: Either direct edits or step-by-step guide
4. **Validation Results**: Confirmation of improvements

## Process Flow

1. **Read all prompts** in the system simultaneously
2. **Map relationships** and dependencies in a graph
3. **Identify redundancies** using the detection criteria
4. **Calculate impact** to determine implementation approach
5. **Plan optimizations** based on significance and risk
6. **Execute improvements** (direct edits or step-by-step)
7. **Validate system** coherence and completeness
8. **Document changes** for future reference

## Example Analysis Format

```text
CURRENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
â”œâ”€â”€ System: prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Defines: Role (AI researcher), Knowledge (techniques), Process (4-step)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Size: 450 lines
â”œâ”€â”€ User: improve_prompt_engineering_assistant.user.prompt.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Defines: Task (improve), Knowledge (techniques - DUPLICATE), Process (research)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Size: 120 lines
â””â”€â”€ Redundancies Found:
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ”´ Critical: Conflicting process definitions
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸŸ¡ Major: Duplicate technique lists (30 lines)
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸŸ¢ Minor: Repeated context setup (5 lines)

PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION:
1. Remove technique list from user prompt â†’ Reference system capabilities
2. Clarify process: System (how to work) vs User (what to do)
3. Extract shared variables â†’ Define once in system prompt

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Total Changes: 45 lines (30 removed, 15 modified)
- Redundancy Reduction: 25% 
- Clarity Score: +40% (measurable by reduced ambiguity)
- Classification: MAJOR (37.5% change)
- Recommendation: Step-by-step implementation with review

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
Step 1: Consolidate knowledge sections...
Step 2: Clarify process boundaries...
Step 3: Update variable references...
```

## Default Target Files

When no files specified, analyze:

- System: `prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md`
- User: `improve_prompt_engineering_assistant.user.prompt.md`

Apply the same optimization principles to any provided prompt system.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-consolidation**: Don't merge everything into system prompt
- **Lost Specificity**: Maintain task-specific details in user prompts
- **Broken References**: Ensure all cross-references remain valid
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Make all requirements explicit
- **Circular Imports**: Prevent prompts from depending on each other circularly
