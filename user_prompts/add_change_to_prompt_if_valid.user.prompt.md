# Add my change if it is valid and beneficial

Is the following change beneficial? Explain why or why not. If it is beneficial, make the change to {{@FILE_NAME}} only.

"{{CHANGE}}"

You WILL:

- Ensure the change follows best practices
- Think systematically about the change
- Incorporate the change in a logical position in the system
- Maintain simplicity and conciseness

You WILL NOT:

- Be overly biased to use the syntax and specific wording of the change as I wrote it above
- Disrupt the overall purpose and flow of the system
- Repeat ideas or increase repetition
- Make significantly complex changes to the system

It is okay to tell me that my idea is not a good idea. Be critical and guarantee high-quality improvements.
