+ 
+ ## Anticipated Executive Questions & Answers
+ 
+ **Q (CFO): "How confident are you in these cost estimates?"**  
+ A: "High confidence on development costs (±10%) - we've broken down into granular tasks with historical benchmarks. Medium confidence on infrastructure (±20%) - depends on actual usage, but we've modeled conservative, expected, and optimistic scenarios. All scenarios show positive ROI."
+ 
+ **Q (CEO): "What if this doesn't deliver the expected ROI?"**  
+ A: "We have phase gates at weeks 6 and 10. If we're not seeing expected value, we can pause, iterate, or stop. The phased approach means you're not committed to the full $[amount] upfront. Week 6 MVP costs $[phase 1 cost] and will validate 80% of the value hypothesis."
+ 
+ **Q (CTO): "Do we have the technical capabilities to maintain this long-term?"**  
+ A: "We've selected technologies that align with our existing stack [list]. We have [N] engineers with the core skills. Training plan addresses gaps in [areas]. Post-launch, estimated 10-15 hours/month maintenance, within current team capacity."
+ 
+ **Q (VP): "How will this impact my team's day-to-day work?"**  
+ A: "Your team will transition from [manual tasks] to [higher-value activities]. The change management plan includes [specific support]. Early adopters report [positive feedback from discovery]. We anticipate [adoption rate] within [timeline] based on the UX design and gradual rollout approach."
+ 
+ **Q: "Why can't we just use [vendor solution] or ChatGPT?"**  
+ A: "We evaluated alternatives. [Vendor solution] costs $[X] but doesn't [specific gap]. ChatGPT is generic and can't [specific requirements like integration, compliance, customization]. Our custom solution delivers [specific advantages] that off-the-shelf tools can't match for our unique workflows."
+ 
+ **Q: "What happens if the project runs over budget or timeline?"**  
+ A: "We've built in 15% contingency for unknowns and 20% optimism bias buffer. Steering committee reviews weekly—any variance >10% triggers executive notification. Historical data shows projects with this level of planning detail hit ±15% of estimates. If we hit the contingency, steering committee decides: absorb, descope, or extend timeline."
