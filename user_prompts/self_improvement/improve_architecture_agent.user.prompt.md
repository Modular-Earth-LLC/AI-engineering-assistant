# Improve Architecture Agent - Targeted Optimization

**Purpose:** Optimize the Architecture Agent for better system design, tech stack recommendations, estimation accuracy, and architectural documentation.

**Target Agent:** `ai_agents/architecture_agent.system.prompt.md`  
**Focus Areas:** System design patterns, tech stack selection, cost/LOE estimation, architecture diagrams, team composition  
**Approach:** Domain-specific best practices + validation  
**Output:** Enhanced architecture agent + validation report

---

## Agent Context

The Architecture Agent is the **design brain** of the AI Engineering Assistant. It:

- Designs AI system architectures based on requirements
- Selects optimal tech stacks (AWS Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Generates architecture diagrams (Mermaid, C4, etc.)
- Estimates costs (AWS, API usage, infrastructure)
- Estimates LOE (level of effort) for implementation
- Defines team composition needs
- Generates project plans
- Writes design decisions to `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json`

**Critical Success Factor:** Architecture quality directly determines implementation success, costs, and maintainability.

## Execution Context

This prompt is **context-agnostic** and can be executed in multiple ways:

### Usage Pattern 1: Orchestrated Improvement
- Called automatically by system-wide optimization workflow
- Part of comprehensive framework improvement cycle
- Results integrated into overall optimization report
