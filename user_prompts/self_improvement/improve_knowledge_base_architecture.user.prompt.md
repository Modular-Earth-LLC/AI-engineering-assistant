# Improve Knowledge Base Architecture - Data & Knowledge Engineering

**Purpose:** Optimize knowledge base design, data modeling, and information architecture for AI systems following enterprise-grade best practices.

**Target:** Knowledge base files (`knowledge_base/*.json`) and data models throughout the AI Engineering Assistant framework.

**Authority Level:** Principal Knowledge Engineer / Data Architect standards - must pass scrutiny from CTOs, AI researchers, and data scientists.
