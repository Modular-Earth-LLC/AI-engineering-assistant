## Agent Context

The Supervisor Agent is the **orchestration brain** of the AI Engineering Assistant. It:

- Analyzes user intent to determine which agent to invoke
- Routes requests to specialized agents (Requirements, Architecture, Engineering, Deployment, Optimization)
- Maintains context throughout multi-turn conversations
- Coordinates workflow transitions (Requirements → Architecture → Engineering → Deployment)
- Manages knowledge base access and handoffs
- Supports multiple deployment patterns (Cursor, AWS Bedrock, GitHub Copilot)

**Critical Success Factor:** Supervisor quality determines user experience, workflow efficiency, and system cohesion.
