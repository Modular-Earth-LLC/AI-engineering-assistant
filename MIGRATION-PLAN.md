- prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md

Look for any references to user prompt file paths and update them to include the `prompt_engineering/` subfolder.

Also add a new optional feature: the Prompt Engineering Assistant can now optionally reference knowledge base files if the user provides them:
- knowledge_base/system_config.json (for platform constraints, team info)
- knowledge_base/user_requirements.json (for requirements context)
- knowledge_base/design_decisions.json (for architecture context)

Add this to the "Context and Knowledge" section with a note that these files are OPTIONAL and only relevant when optimizing prompts for systems tracked in the knowledge base.

List all changes made with line numbers.
```

**Validation**: Check file, ensure paths updated, knowledge base mention added

---

## üîß Phase 3: Integration & Refactoring (2-3 hours)

### ‚òê Step 3.1: Integrate Prompt Engineering Assistant with Supervisor (30 minutes)

**Cursor Prompt #3:**

```text
Update the Supervisor Agent (supervisor_agent.system.prompt.md) to recognize the Prompt Engineering Assistant as the 6th specialized agent.

Changes needed:

1. In the "System Architecture Overview" section, add Prompt Engineering Agent to the agent list:
   - Add after Optimization Agent: "‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Prompt Engineering Agent ‚Üí Prompt creation, improvement, multi-prompt optimization"

2. In the "Specialized Agents Reference" section, add a new subsection for Prompt Engineering Agent:
   Location: `prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md`
   
   Responsibilities:
   - Create new prompts from scratch
   - Improve existing prompts
   - Optimize multi-prompt systems
   - Reduce redundancy across prompt workflows
   - Platform-specific optimization (Cursor, Claude, GPT, etc.)
   
   User Prompts:
   - `user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_prompt_engineering_assistant.user.prompt.md`
   - `user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_system_of_prompts.user.prompt.md`
   - `user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_prompt_with_human_in_the_loop.user.prompt.md`
   - `user_prompts/prompt_engineering/reduce_prompt_redundancy.user.prompt.md`
   
   Knowledge Base Access:
   - READS (optional): system_config.json (for platform constraints)
   - READS (optional): user_requirements.json, design_decisions.json (for context when optimizing system prompts)
   - Does NOT write to knowledge base (independent operation)
   
   When to Route Here:
   - User needs to create new prompts or agents
   - User wants to improve existing prompts
   - User needs to optimize prompt systems for redundancy or efficiency
   - User needs platform-specific prompt optimization
   - Any agent (Requirements, Architecture, Engineering, Deployment, Optimization) needs prompt engineering support

3. Update "Agent Selection Logic" to include prompt engineering scenarios.

4. Add routing examples for prompt engineering requests in the "Example Interactions" section.

5. Update workflow documentation to show how Prompt Engineering Agent integrates with other agents (e.g., Engineering Agent may invoke Prompt Engineering Agent to create prompts for target systems).

Make these changes while preserving all existing content and functionality. List all changes with section names and line numbers.
```

**Validation**: Read updated Supervisor Agent file, verify Prompt Engineering Agent properly integrated

---

### ‚òê Step 3.2: Update Engineering Agent to Reference Prompt Engineering Assistant (20 minutes)

**Cursor Prompt #4:**

```
Update the Engineering Agent (ai_agents/engineering_agent.system.prompt.md) to reference the Prompt Engineering Assistant as a specialized capability it can invoke.

Changes needed:

1. Add a section explaining that when the Engineering Agent needs to create prompts for target systems, it should reference or invoke the Prompt Engineering Assistant.

2. Add guidance: "When generating agent prompts for target systems, leverage the Prompt Engineering Assistant's capabilities for optimal prompt design, platform-specific optimization, and validation."

3. In the capabilities or tools section, add:
   "Prompt Engineering Support: Can reference prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md for creating well-engineered prompts for target AI systems"

4. Note that the Engineering Agent from this repository will eventually be split into multiple specialized agents (UI Development, API Development, Prompt Engineering, etc.), and Prompt Engineering Assistant will be one of those specialized capabilities.

Make minimal changes - just add the connection points. Don't restructure the entire file. List all changes.
```

**Validation**: Check Engineering Agent file for new references

---

### ‚òê Step 3.3: Resolve Naming Conflicts - "Optimization" vs "Improvement" (40 minutes)

**Analysis First:**
The Architecture Assistant has an "Optimization Agent" that optimizes entire AI systems.
The Engineering Assistant has "improve" prompts that improve individual prompts.

These are DIFFERENT concepts:

- **Optimize** (Optimization Agent): Broad system-level improvements across multiple agents, following Well-Architected principles
- **Improve** (Prompt Engineering): Narrow prompt-level improvements for individual prompts or prompt systems

**Cursor Prompt #5:**

```
Analyze and clarify the distinction between "optimization" (system-level) and "improvement" (prompt-level) across all files in the repository.

Context:
- Optimization Agent (ai_agents/optimization_agent.system.prompt.md): Optimizes entire AI systems, multi-agent architectures, following AWS Well-Architected principles
- Prompt Engineering user prompts (user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_*.md): Improve individual prompts or prompt systems

These are DIFFERENT scopes and should be clearly distinguished.

Tasks:
1. Review all files that use "optimize", "optimization", "improve", or "improvement"
2. Verify each usage is contextually clear (system-level vs prompt-level)
3. Add clarifying comments or documentation where ambiguity exists
4. Update any cross-references to use precise terminology

Create a terminology guide snippet that can be added to relevant files:
```

## Terminology: Optimization vs Improvement

**System Optimization** (Optimization Agent):

- Scope: Entire AI systems, multi-agent architectures
- Focus: AWS Well-Architected principles, lifecycle awareness, measurable business impact
- Location: ai_agents/optimization_agent.system.prompt.md
- User Prompts: user_prompts/optimization/*

**Prompt Improvement** (Prompt Engineering Assistant):

- Scope: Individual prompts, prompt systems, prompt workflows
- Focus: Clarity, efficiency, platform optimization, redundancy reduction
- Location: prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md
- User Prompts: user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_*

**Integration**: Optimization Agent may invoke Prompt Engineering Assistant to improve prompts as part of system-wide optimization.

```

List all files reviewed and any changes made.
```

**Validation**: Review terminology guide, check for clarity

---

### ‚òê Step 3.4: Update User Prompt Cross-References (30 minutes)

**Cursor Prompt #6:**

```
Update all user prompts in user_prompts/optimization/ to reference correct file paths after the repository reorganization.

Specifically, check these files for references to other prompts or agents:
- user_prompts/optimization/improve_ai_architecture_assistant.user.prompt.md (may reference other improvement prompts)
- user_prompts/optimization/improve_optimization_agent.user.prompt.md (may reference system prompts)
- All other improvement prompts in optimization folder

Tasks:
1. Find all file path references in these user prompts
2. Verify paths are correct after reorganization
3. Update any broken references
4. Add note at top of each optimization user prompt: "This prompt optimizes AI systems and multi-agent architectures. For improving individual prompts, see user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_*.md"

List all files checked and any changes made.
```

---

### ‚òê Step 3.5: Create Cross-Reference Documentation (20 minutes)

**Cursor Prompt #7:**

```
Create a new file: docs/agent-relationships.md

This file should document:
1. All 6 specialized agents and their relationships
2. How Prompt Engineering Assistant integrates with the multi-agent system
3. When to use each agent
4. How agents can invoke or reference each other
5. Workflow examples showing agent collaboration

Use the Supervisor Agent's documentation as a reference, but create a more focused relationship diagram.

Include:
- Visual diagram (ASCII art) of agent relationships
- Table of agent capabilities and when to use each
- Common workflows (e.g., "System Optimization invoking Prompt Engineering")
- File path references for all agents and their user prompts

Format: Markdown with clear sections, easy to scan
```

**Validation**: Review new file, ensure accuracy

---

### ‚òê Step 3.6: Test Individual Agents (30 minutes)

**Manual Testing in Cursor:**
