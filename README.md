# AI Engineering Assistant

**Systematic AI development framework** for Cursor IDE. Design, architect, and deploy production AI systems through a multi-agent workflow‚Äîfrom requirements gathering to deployment guidance.

## Overview

Developing AI systems requires coordinated expertise across requirements, architecture, engineering, and deployment. This framework provides 6 specialized agents running in Cursor IDE that guide you through the complete development lifecycle with systematic rigor.

**What it does**: Transforms your AI system concept into production-ready implementations through structured, multi-agent workflows.

**Where it runs**: Cursor IDE (or VS Code with GitHub Copilot). Generates AI systems deployable to any platform including OpenAI, Claude Projects, AWS Bedrock, and custom infrastructure.

## Quick Start

### Complete System Development (15 minutes)

1. **Install**: Copy `supervisor_agent.system.prompt.md` to Cursor Settings ‚Üí Chat ‚Üí Custom Modes
2. **Start**: Open Cursor AI Pane, select "Supervisor Agent"
3. **Request**: "Build a financial operations assistant"
4. **Follow**: Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Engineering ‚Üí Deployment
5. **Deploy**: To your chosen platform

### Prompt Engineering Only (5 minutes)

1. **Load**: `ai_agents/prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md` in Cursor
2. **Request**: "Create a code review assistant for OpenAI GPT"
3. **Deploy**: Copy generated prompt to target platform

## Key Capabilities

### Knowledge Base State Management
All agents share context through JSON files in `knowledge_base/`:
- `system_config.json`: Platform constraints, team info, Well-Architected definitions
- `user_requirements.json`: Business requirements, success criteria (Requirements Agent)
- `design_decisions.json`: Architecture decisions, costs, plans (Architecture Agent)

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Supervisor routes requests to specialized agents based on intent analysis
- Seamless agent handoffs preserve full context across transitions
- Agents collaborate effectively on complex multi-phase workflows
- Clear separation of concerns across agent domains

### Production-Ready Outputs
- Working prototypes with production-ready implementation code
- Platform-optimized prompts for OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock, and Cursor
- Deployment guides with detailed step-by-step instructions
- Comprehensive cost estimates and project implementation plans

## Installation

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

## Glossary

**Optimize** ‚Äî Comprehensive system-level improvements following Well-Architected principles. Use the Optimization Agent for entire AI systems.

**Improve** ‚Äî Targeted enhancements to specific components. Agent improvements use `self_improvement/` prompts; prompt improvements use the Prompt Engineering Assistant.

**Enhance** ‚Äî User experience and documentation improvements.

## Troubleshooting

**Agent can't find knowledge base**  
Ensure running from repository root. Paths: `knowledge_base/*.json`

**Supervisor not routing correctly**  
Be specific: "Build a customer support system" not "I need help"

**Missing context between agents**  
Verify knowledge base files populated by previous agent

**Wrong platform deployment**  
Specify target: "Deploy to AWS Bedrock" not just "Deploy"
