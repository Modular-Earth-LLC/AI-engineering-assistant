**Key Distinction**:
- **Prompts IN this repo**: Run in Cursor/VS Code as custom agents to help YOU engineer prompts
- **Prompts GENERATED by these agents**: Deploy to external platforms (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) for end users

**Core Innovation**: The Prompt Engineering Assistant agent can progressively improve itself on a schedule based on the latest research and current AI platform capabilities.

## Quick Start

**Set up your Cursor agent and generate your first validated prompt in 5 minutes:**

1. **Download** `ai_agents/prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md` from this repository
2. **Install as Cursor agent**: Open Cursor Settings → Chat → Custom Modes → Paste content (see Installation section)
3. **Send a task**: "Create a code review assistant for OpenAI GPT" or "Improve my Claude prompt"
4. **Answer 2-3 quick questions**: Target platform for generated prompt, optimization focus
5. **Receive validated output**: Copy-paste ready prompt for external deployment with character count

The agent progressively gathers only essential requirements, letting you work at your preferred speed.

**What you're creating**: Prompts for deployment to OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock, etc.  
**Where you're working**: In Cursor AI Pane, using this repo's agent

## Interactive Workflow in Action

Experience how the Cursor agent prevents deployment failures through intelligent requirements gathering:

```markdown
You (in Cursor AI Pane): "Create a code review assistant"

Agent: "I'll help you create a code review assistant. To optimize for your needs:

Which platform will this be deployed to?
- OpenAI GPT (~1,500 chars)
- Anthropic Claude (~32,000 chars)
- AWS Bedrock
- Other (please specify)"

You: "GPT"

Agent: "For a code review assistant on GPT, I'll create a concise prompt.
Any specific focus areas? (security, performance, style, or I'll determine)"

You: "Focus on security"

Agent: "Creating security-focused code review assistant for GPT deployment...

[Generates complete prompt ready for OpenAI custom instructions]
[1,423 / 1,500 characters]"
```

The agent asks only what's necessary—if you provide an existing prompt, it infers domain and complexity automatically.

**Clarification**: You're chatting with the Cursor agent in YOUR workspace. The agent generates prompts for EXTERNAL platform deployment.

## Installation and Configuration

**Important**: These installation steps set up agents IN YOUR IDE (Cursor/VS Code). These agents then help you create prompts for deployment TO external platforms (OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock, etc.).

### For Cursor (Recommended)

**Purpose**: Install the Prompt Engineering Assistant as a Cursor agent in your workspace

1. Download `ai_agents/prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md` from this repository
2. Open Cursor Settings → Chat → Custom Modes
3. Click "New Mode" and name it "Prompt Engineering Assistant"  
4. Select "All tools enabled"
5. Paste the entire file contents into Instructions
6. Save and select from the dropdown in any chat
7. **Start using**: Send tasks like "Create a GPT for code review" or "Improve my Claude prompt"

### For VS Code / GitHub Copilot

**Purpose**: Install the agent as a VS Code custom chat mode

1. The workspace includes a ready-to-use mode: `.github/chatmodes/prompt_engineering_assistant.chatmode.md`
2. Open Chat (⌃⌘I) → Select "Prompt Engineering Assistant" mode from the dropdown
3. Tools: ensure `codebase`, `search`, `fetch`, and (if available) `websearch` are enabled
4. Use default Prompt Builder persona; explicitly request Prompt Tester when validating
5. **Start using**: Send user prompts from the `user_prompts/` directory

### Using Github Copilot Coding Agent (For Recursive Self-Improvement)

**Purpose**: Automate iterative improvements to the agents themselves

- **Handoff to Copilot Coding Agent**:
  - Create a new issue using template "Prompt Improvement: Copilot Agent" and assign to `github-copilot-agent`
  - Or paste `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent` in VS Code chat
  - Agent creates a branch and PR, iterates based on your review comments

- **Scheduled Upkeep** (Optional):
  - Weekly workflow: `.github/workflows/copilot-prompt-improvement.yml` (Mondays 14:00 UTC)
  - Opens/updates improvement issues assigned to the agent
  - Run on demand via Actions tab with custom inputs

### Advanced: Running Agent Prompts in Other Platforms

**Not recommended but possible**: While these agents are optimized for Cursor/Copilot with tool access, you can run them in Claude Projects or ChatGPT as custom instructions. Functionality will be limited without file access and search capabilities. This defeats the purpose—use them in Cursor/VS Code instead.

## Implementation Examples

These examples show the Cursor agent in action, creating prompts for external platform deployment.

### Platform Migration: GPT to Claude

**Challenge**: Marketing team's customer analysis prompt exceeded OpenAI's 1,500 character limit

**Workflow in Cursor**:

```markdown
You (in Cursor AI Pane): "Improve my customer segmentation prompt"
[Attach existing prompt file]

Agent: "I'll help you improve this prompt. Which platform will this be deployed to?"

You: "OpenAI GPT"

Agent: "Your current prompt is 3,200 characters. For GPT's ~1,500 limit, I'll:
       1. Extract examples to external documentation
       2. Compress instructions using structured format
       3. Maintain all functionality"

[Agent generates optimized prompt]
Result: [1,487 / 1,500 characters] - Ready for GPT deployment
```

**Impact**: 100% deployment success rate, 0% functionality loss, 54% size reduction

**What happened**: You used the Cursor agent to optimize a prompt FOR deployment TO OpenAI GPT

### Healthcare Diagnostic Assistant

**Challenge**: Medical AI prompt required comprehensive testing due to domain sensitivity

**Workflow in Cursor**:

```markdown
You (in Cursor AI Pane): "Create a symptom analysis assistant for Claude"

Agent: "I'll create a healthcare assistant. Given the medical domain, I'll apply 
       comprehensive validation and safety constraints.
       
       Which specific aspects should it focus on? (triage, education, referral)"

You: "Patient education and when to seek care"

Agent: [Generates prompt with safety guardrails]
       → Comprehensive testing for medical edge cases
       → Safety constraint verification
       → Explicit limitations and disclaimers
       
Result: Production-ready prompt for Claude Projects deployment
```

**Impact**: Medical-grade validation preventing misdiagnosis scenarios, ready for Claude deployment

**What happened**: You used the Cursor agent to create a healthcare prompt FOR deployment TO Claude Projects

### Multi-Prompt System Optimization

**Challenge**: Token inefficiency and redundant context across related prompts in your prompt library

**Workflow in Cursor**:

```markdown
You (in Cursor AI Pane): [Send user_prompts/prompt_engineering/improve_system_of_prompts.user.prompt.md]
                         [Attach your 3 technical documentation prompts]

Agent: [Analyzes prompt system]
       → Identifies redundancies across prompts
       → Proposes consolidation strategy
       → Validates optimized system
       
Result: 27% token reduction, clearer separation of concerns, all functionality preserved
```

**Impact**: More efficient prompt library, faster execution, maintained functionality

**What happened**: You used the Cursor agent's system optimization capabilities to improve prompts in YOUR library (which may be deployed anywhere)

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Interactive Workflow Issues

**Agent asks too many questions**: Provide context upfront. The agent infers requirements from existing prompts and clear initial requests like "Create a code review GPT" or "Improve my Claude prompt for healthcare".

**Generated prompt exceeds character limit**: The agent automatically suggests optimizations for the target platform. Accept compression suggestions or request a different deployment platform with higher limits.

**Wrong target platform**: Say "Actually, I need this deployed to [platform]" and the agent will re-optimize the generated prompt for that platform.

**Agent doesn't have file access**: Ensure you're running in Cursor or VS Code with proper tool permissions. The agent needs file system access to read and optimize prompts.

### Platform Configuration

**Cursor Setup**: Enable "All tools" in Custom Mode settings for full capabilities (file reading, search, web research)

**VS Code Setup**: Ensure tools (`codebase`, `search`, `fetch`, `websearch`) are enabled in chat mode configuration

**Generated Prompt Deployment**: Copy generated prompts directly to target platform (OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock, etc.)

### Architecture Questions

**Confused about two-tier system?** See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete explanation
