# AI Engineering Assistant

Production-ready prompt engineering system that delivers platform-optimized AI prompts through interactive requirements gathering and systematic validation.

## Overview

This project addresses the fundamental challenge of prompt reliability in production AI environments. Built through extensive testing, it delivers measurable improvements in prompt consistency and reduces engineering overhead.

**Core Innovation**: Ability for the Prompt Engineering Assistant to progressively improve itself on a schedule based on the latest research and current AI platform capabilities. Let the AI singularity begin!

## Quick Start

**Deploy your first validated prompt in 5 minutes:**

1. **Download** `prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md` from this repository
2. **Load into your AI platform**: Cursor, Claude, or any system supporting custom instructions  
3. **Start with your request**: "Create a code review assistant" or "Improve my existing prompt"
4. **Answer 2-3 quick questions**: Platform target, optimization focus (system determines the rest)
5. **Receive validated output**: Platform-optimized prompt with character count verification

The system progressively gathers only essential requirements, letting you work at your preferred speed.

## Interactive Workflow in Action

Experience how the system prevents deployment failures through intelligent requirements gathering:

```markdown
You: "Create a code review assistant"

System: "I'll help you create a code review assistant. To optimize for your needs:

Which platform will this run on?
- OpenAI GPT (~1,500 chars)
- Anthropic Claude (~32,000 chars)
- Other (please specify)"

You: "GPT"

System: "For a code review assistant on GPT, I'll create a concise prompt.
Any specific focus areas? (security, performance, style, or I'll determine)"

You: "Focus on security"

System: "Creating security-focused code review assistant for GPT...
[1,423 / 1,500 characters]"
```

The system asks only what's necessary—if you provide an existing prompt, it infers domain and complexity automatically.

## Technical Innovation

### Interactive Requirements Architecture

This system pioneered **conversational requirements gathering** that prevents the #1 cause of prompt deployment failures: platform incompatibility.

**Key Innovations**:

- **Progressive Interaction Model**: Gathers requirements in logical clusters, asking only what's necessary
- **Platform-Aware Optimization**: Hard-coded character limits for major platforms prevent overflow failures
- **Smart Inference Engine**: Analyzes existing prompts to skip redundant questions, respecting engineer time
- **Risk Transparency**: Clearly communicates consequences of missing requirements without blocking progress

### Enhanced 5-Step Methodology

1. **Interactive Requirements**: Conversational gathering of platform, domain, and optimization preferences
2. **Research Phase**: Platform-specific analysis using empirical data and current best practices
3. **Multi-Path Testing**: Validation scaled to domain sensitivity (healthcare: comprehensive, creative: minimal)
4. **Systematic Enhancement**: Optimization focused on gathered requirements and platform constraints
5. **Final Confirmation**: Character count validation and platform compatibility verification

### Advanced Engineering Features

- **Dual-Persona Architecture**: Prompt Builder creates, Prompt Tester validates—systematic quality assurance
- **Tree-of-Thoughts Processing**: Evaluates multiple solution paths simultaneously for optimal design
- **Self-Consistency Validation**: Multiple reasoning paths ensure robust, production-ready outputs

## Installation and Configuration

### For Cursor (Recommended)

1. Download `prompt_engineering_assistant.system.prompt.md` from this repository
2. Open Cursor Settings → Chat → Custom Modes
3. Click "New Mode" and name it "Prompt Engineering Assistant"  
4. Select "All tools enabled"
5. Paste the entire file contents into Instructions
6. Save and select from the dropdown in any chat

### For VS Code Chat Mode

1. The workspace includes a ready-to-use mode: `.github/chatmodes/prompt_engineering_assistant.chatmode.md`.
2. Open Chat (⌃⌘I) → Select "Prompt Engineering Assistant" mode from the dropdown.
3. Tools: ensure `codebase`, `search`, `fetch`, and (if available) `websearch` are enabled; approve tool prompts when asked.
4. Use default Prompt Builder persona for improvements; explicitly request Prompt Tester when validating outputs.

### Using a Github Copilot Coding Agent (For Recursive Improvements)

- Handoff to Copilot Coding Agent
  - Create a new issue using the template "Prompt Improvement: Copilot Agent" and assign it to `github-copilot-agent`.
  - Or paste the following tag into a VS Code chat to hand off the current task:
    - `#github-pull-request_copilot-coding-agent`
  - The agent will create a branch and PR, then iterate based on your PR review comments.

- Scheduled Upkeep (Optional)
  - A weekly workflow opens/updates a prompt improvement issue and assigns it to the agent:
    - `.github/workflows/copilot-prompt-improvement.yml` (defaults: Mondays 14:00 UTC)
  - You can also run it on demand via the Actions tab with custom inputs.

### For Other AI Platforms

Copy the system prompt and use it as custom instructions in Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI platform supporting system prompts. Core functionality remains available even without platform-specific features.

## Implementation Examples

### Platform Migration: GPT to Claude

**Challenge**: Marketing team's complex customer analysis prompt exceeded OpenAI's 1,500 character limit.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
User: "Improve my customer segmentation prompt"
System: "I'll help you improve this prompt. Which platform will this run on?"
User: "OpenAI GPT"
System: "Your current prompt is 3,200 characters. For GPT's ~1,500 limit, I'll:
        1. Extract examples to external docs
        2. Compress instructions using structured format
        3. Maintain all functionality"
Result: [1,487 / 1,500 characters] - Fully functional, platform-optimized
```

**Impact**: 100% deployment success rate, 0% functionality loss, 54% size reduction.

### Healthcare Diagnostic Assistant

**Challenge**: Medical AI prompt required comprehensive testing due to domain sensitivity.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
User: "Create a symptom analysis assistant"
System: "What's the main purpose of this prompt?
        - Domain: healthcare
        - Testing depth: I'll apply comprehensive validation"
Process: Automatic comprehensive testing triggered by healthcare domain
        → Edge case validation for medical scenarios
        → Safety constraint verification
```

**Result**: Production-ready prompt with medical-grade validation, preventing potential misdiagnosis scenarios.

### Multi-Prompt Workflow Optimization

**Challenge**: Token inefficiency and redundant context across related prompts in complex workflows.

**Implementation**:

```markdown
System: improve_system_of_prompts.user.prompt.md
Target: 3-prompt workflow for technical documentation
Process: Redundancy detection → Information flow optimization → Validation
```

**Result**: token reduction, faster prompt execution, maintained functionality.

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Interactive Workflow Issues

**System asks too many questions**: Check if you're providing context upfront. The system infers requirements from existing prompts and clear initial requests.

**Character count exceeded**: The system automatically suggests optimizations. Accept compression suggestions or request platform-specific version.

**Wrong platform selected**: Simply say "Actually, I need this for [correct platform]" and the system will re-optimize.

### Platform Configuration

**Cursor Setup**: Enable "All tools" in Custom Mode settings for full interactive capabilities

**Claude/GPT Setup**: Paste entire system prompt; interactive workflow functions without modification

**Character-Limited Platforms**: Request a "minimal version for [platform]" to get core functionality within limits
