- Engineering Agent invokes Prompt Engineering Agent
- Shows prompt creation for target systems
- Documents handoff pattern

**Pattern C: Optimization + Prompt Engineering Collaboration**
- Optimization Agent recommends Prompt Engineering
- Shows system-level + prompt-level optimization
- Documents aggregated improvements

**Pattern D: Multi-Prompt System Optimization**
- Multi-prompt redundancy reduction
- Shows system analysis and consolidation
- Documents validation process

---

### 7. Platform-Specific Adaptations (Lines ~1045-1070)

**Updated Bedrock deployment pseudo-code:**

Added to sub_agents list:
```python
"prompt-engineering-agent"
```

Now shows 6 sub-agents instead of 5.

---

### 8. Metadata Update (Lines ~1170-1176)

**Updated version and metadata:**
- Version: 0.1 → 0.2
- Last Updated: 2025-10-05 → 2025-10-09
- Added: Agent Count: 6 Specialized Agents (Requirements, Architecture, Engineering, Deployment, Optimization, Prompt Engineering)

---

## Summary Statistics

## Key Integration Points Highlighted

1. **Independence:** Prompt Engineering Agent operates independently (doesn't require knowledge base)
2. **Optional Context:** Can read knowledge base files for system-aware optimization
3. **Cross-Agent Support:** Engineering and Optimization agents can invoke for prompt support
4. **Platform Optimization:** Specialized in platform-specific constraints (character limits, features)
5. **Dual-Persona Validation:** Uses Prompt Builder + Prompt Tester architecture
6. **System-Level Optimization:** Can optimize multi-prompt systems for redundancy

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test routing: "Create a code review assistant" → Should route to Prompt Engineering Agent
2. Test improvement: "Optimize my prompt for Claude" → Should route to Prompt Engineering Agent
3. Test multi-agent: "Build AI system" → Should show Engineering + Prompt Engineering collaboration
4. Test system optimization: "My prompts are redundant" → Should route to improve_system_of_prompts
5. Verify Prompt Engineering Agent can optionally read knowledge base files
6. Verify agent operates independently without knowledge base
