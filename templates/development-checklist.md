## Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP) Criteria

A successful prototype must include:

✅ **Functional Agents**
- Minimum 3 agents addressing top priorities from requirements
- Each agent responds intelligently to realistic inputs
- Agents produce useful, relevant outputs

✅ **Agent Coordination**
- Agents can hand off tasks to each other when appropriate
- Orchestration logic routes requests to correct agent
- Multi-agent workflows function end-to-end

✅ **Tool Integration**
- At least one integration with stakeholder primary tool
- Can retrieve data from stakeholder systems (even if simulated)
- Can generate outputs in stakeholder required format

✅ **User Interface**
- Simple, intuitive interface for agent interaction
- Clear indication of which agent is responding
- Ability to test different scenarios during demo

✅ **Demo Scenarios**
- Minimum 5 realistic scenarios based on stakeholder actual workflows
- Scenarios demonstrate clear value (time savings, quality improvement)
- Scenarios show agent coordination and tool integration

✅ **Documentation**
- Brief user guide explaining how to interact with each agent
- Description of each agent's capabilities and limitations
- Quick-start guide for getting started

## Quality Checks Before Stakeholder Demo

### Functionality Checks
- [ ] All agents respond within acceptable timeframe (<10 seconds for most queries)
- [ ] Agents produce relevant, high-quality outputs
- [ ] No obvious errors or bugs in demo scenarios
- [ ] Agent handoffs work smoothly
- [ ] Tool integrations function correctly

### User Experience Checks
- [ ] Interface is intuitive and clear
- [ ] Agent responses are formatted well
- [ ] Clear indication of agent activity (loading states)
- [ ] Error messages are helpful, not technical
- [ ] System works on stakeholder likely setup (browser, device)

### Content Quality Checks
- [ ] Agent outputs reflect stakeholder brand voice
- [ ] Agents use stakeholder preferred terminology
- [ ] Generated content is professional and polished
- [ ] No placeholder text or dummy data visible to stakeholder
- [ ] Outputs match quality standards from requirements

### Demo Preparation Checks
- [ ] All 5 demo scenarios tested and working
- [ ] Demo script prepared with talking points
- [ ] Backup plan if technical issues occur
- [ ] Screen recording as fallback
- [ ] Anticipated questions have prepared answers
- [ ] Demo environment stable and tested

## Common Development Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall:** Building too many agents instead of focusing on quality
**Solution:** Start with 3 high-impact agents. Better to have 3 excellent agents than 7 mediocre ones.

**Pitfall:** Over-engineering the coordination logic
**Solution:** Simple orchestration is fine for prototype. Don't build complex multi-agent frameworks yet.

**Pitfall:** Pursuing perfect tool integration
**Solution:** Simulated data is acceptable for prototype. Show the value first, perfect the integration later.

**Pitfall:** Spending too much time on UI polish
**Solution:** Functional and clear beats beautiful and buggy. Polish can come in production version.

**Pitfall:** Testing only happy-path scenarios
**Solution:** Test failure modes. What happens when agent doesn't understand input? When tool integration fails?

**Pitfall:** Neglecting documentation
**Solution:** If stakeholder can't figure out how to use it, it doesn't matter how well it works. Document as you build.

**Pitfall:** Waiting until Day 14 to test everything together
**Solution:** Integrate and test continuously. Don't save integration for the end.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** LLM produces inconsistent outputs
**Mitigation:** 
- Use temperature=0 for consistency
- Provide extensive examples in prompts
- Test repeatedly with same inputs to ensure consistency
- Build output validation logic

**Risk:** Tool API doesn't work as expected
**Mitigation:**
- Test API calls early (Day 3-4)
- Have fallback to simulated data
- Document API limitations in demo

**Risk:** Agent coordination fails during demo
**Mitigation:**
- Test coordination logic extensively
- Have manual override capability
- Prepare to demo agents individually if needed

**Risk:** Performance too slow for live demo
**Mitigation:**
- Test on stakeholder-similar network conditions
- Cache common queries
- Have pre-run examples as backup

### Timeline Risks

**Risk:** Development takes longer than 2 weeks
**Mitigation:**
- Cut scope to MVP if needed
- Communicate proactively with stakeholder if delay needed
- Prioritize highest-value agents

**Risk:** Stakeholder requirements were incomplete
**Mitigation:**
- Flag gaps early (Day 1-2)
- Reach out to stakeholder for clarification immediately
- Make reasonable assumptions and document them
