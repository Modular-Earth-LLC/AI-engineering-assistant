# Project Handoff Checklist

**Purpose:** Ensure smooth transition from prototype to production or stakeholder ownership  
**When to use:** After demo approval, before stakeholder takes ownership

---

## Overview

Project handoff is the final delivery phase where you transfer the system (and knowledge about it) to the stakeholder or production team. A complete handoff ensures the system can be maintained, improved, and operated without you.

## Tips for Smooth Handoff

1. **Start documentation early** - Don't wait until the end
2. **Test documentation with someone new** - Can they follow it?
3. **Over-communicate** - When in doubt, add more detail
4. **Show, don't just tell** - Live walkthroughs beat written docs
5. **Leave time for questions** - Don't rush handoff
6. **Stay available initially** - First week is critical
7. **Get signoff** - Makes completion official
8. **Follow up proactively** - Check in, don't wait for problems

---

**Remember:** A good handoff makes the stakeholder self-sufficient while giving them confidence you're still available if needed. Balance enabling independence with providing safety nets.
